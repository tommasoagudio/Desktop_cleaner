# Desktop_cleaner
A simple desktop cleaner that will move ALL the files on your desktop onto a new folder located in "C:/" that has the name as the current date and time. 


The .exe and .py files are both available for download, the .exe will simply run and do the work (can work on any machine and python isn't needed) while the .py file will print a confirmation message when the script has finished (must run it throug python from the terminal). 


Please note that that in the near future a GUI will be implemented and also the opportunity to choose the folder name and destination.
